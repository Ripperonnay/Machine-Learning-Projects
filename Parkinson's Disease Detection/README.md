# Parkinson's Disease Detection - Classification 
Develop a ML classification model for detecting Parkinson's disease by analyzing patient data, aiding in the accurate diagnosis of this neurological condition.

## Dataset Information

It contains 195 data records, 24 columns (including target).

```
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with
Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row
corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of
the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column
which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.
