# Heart Disease Prediction - Classification

Create an ML model for predicting heart disease by analyzing relevant features, aiding in identifying potential heart health issues accurately.

## Dataset Information

It contains 303 data records, 14 columns (including target)
```
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
target : 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
