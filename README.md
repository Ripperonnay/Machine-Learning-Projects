# Machine-Learning-Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects that cover a range of machine learning concepts and techniques. Though most of these projects draw inspiration from tutorials, I've implemented all of the projects myself. These hands-on implementations have helped me gain a deeper understanding. Each  machine learning project covers a specific concept, technique, or algorithm. I have also learnt a handful of data pre-processing techniques when encountered with random errors while developing the models. The projects contain some specific notes, comments & remarks as they reflect my learning process and can provide insights for anyone exploring the project (might just be completely irrelevant to you). I am still learning and acquiring more knowledge in the field. The intention is to showcase my learning journey in machine learning.

This is at a starting point. A non-exhaustive list. My aim is to consistently update and expand this repository with new projects.
