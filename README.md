# Machine-Learning-Projects
Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects that cover a range of machine learning concepts and techniques. Though most of these projects draw inspiration from tutorials, each one has been fully implemented by me. Through these hands-on implementations, I've not only gained a deeper understanding but also documented my learning process through project notes. Each  machine learning project covers a specific concept, technique, or algorithm. I have also learnt handful of data-pre processing techniques when encountered with random errors, which I didn't know how to handle at the time. The projects randomly contains some specific notes, comments & remarks as they reflect my learning process and can provide insights for anyone exploring the project (might just be completely irrelevant to you). 

This is at a starting point. A non-exhaustive list. My goal is to constantly upload and fill this repo with projects.
